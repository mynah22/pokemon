Bug ID 0001:
    3/18/2019
    modules:
        zones.py
        hunt.py
    description:
        randomrange does not function with identical
        high and low range values. Several 
        pokemon-encounter-tuples (items in the zone's
        pokelist) have the same high and low level 
        limits. Hunt.py uses randomrange (as rrang) 
        to determine wild pokemon level, with the 
        range limits in a pokemon-encounter-tuple,
        and therefore fails.
    to reproduce:
        navigate to viridian forest and hunt

    Completed:

        Solution:
            check if level limits are equal at 
            poke spawn. If so, do not call rrang,
            use low level limit.
